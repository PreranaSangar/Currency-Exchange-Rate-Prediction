# Currency Exchange Rate Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
Currency exchange rates are highly volatile and influenced by various macroeconomic factors. This project leverages **machine learning techniques** to predict **currency exchange rates**, focusing on the **Indian Rupee (INR) exchange rate**. The goal is to provide accurate and reliable predictions that help businesses, investors, and policymakers make informed financial decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset consists of **2632 rows** and **7 attributes**:  
- **Date** â€“ The date of exchange rate observation.  
- **Price** â€“ The INR exchange rate value on that date.  
- **Open** â€“ The exchange rate at the start of the trading session.  
- **High** â€“ The highest recorded exchange rate of the day.  
- **Low** â€“ The lowest recorded exchange rate of the day.  
- **Volume (Vol.)** â€“ The total number of trades made in the given period.  
- **Change (%)** â€“ The percentage change in exchange rate compared to the previous day.  

## ðŸš€ Machine Learning Models Used  
The following machine learning models were implemented for exchange rate prediction:  
- **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)**   

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance  
The accuracy of the models was evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**. The **SARIMA** model demonstrated strong performance in identifying seasonal trends, while **LSTM-based models** showed promise in capturing complex time-dependent patterns.  

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup  
To run this project on your local system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PreranaSangar/currency-exchange-rate-prediction.git
   cd currency-exchange-rate-prediction
2.pip install -r requirements.txt
3.python main.py

ðŸ“Œ Features
Uses historical exchange rate data to make accurate forecasts.
Implements time series analysis and deep learning models.
Supports multi-currency exchange rate prediction.
Provides visualizations for better trend analysis.

ðŸ“œ Conclusion
This project demonstrates that SARIMA and deep learning models (LSTM, RNN) can provide reliable exchange rate forecasts. These predictions can aid financial institutions, traders, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions, reducing risks associated with currency fluctuations.
